Tile :Nirvana - My Girl
This is lyrics from www.lyrics007.com

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me, 
Tell me where did you sleep last night? 

In the pines, in the pines 
Where the sun will never shine 
I would shiver the whole night through 

My girl, my girl, where will you go? 
I'm going where the cold wind blows 

In the pines, in the pines 
Where the sun will never shine 
I would shiver the whole night through 

Her husband, was a hard working man 
Just about a mile from here 
His head was found in a driving wheel 
But his body never was found 

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me, 
Tell me where did you sleep last night? 

In the pines, in the pines 
Where the sun will never shine 
I would shiver the whole night through 

My girl, my girl, where will you go? 
I'm going where the cold wind blows 

In the pines, in the pines 
Where the will never shine 
I would shiver the whole night through
